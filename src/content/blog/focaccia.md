I went to Italy over the summer, and one of my favorite foods there was the focaccia. By itself or as a sandwich, its easily one of the best breads I have ever had. Yet, I have yet to find any focaccia at any local market. So, I wanted to take a shot at making it at home. I used Daen's Kitchen's No Knead Focaccia recipe.  
<br/>
My mom had already tried a few times before. The problem with hers was that it wasn't poofy at all, very different from the actual focaccia. It tasted good but I wanted to try the focaccia I had in Italy again.  
<br/>  
My first attempt was pretty much the same result as my mom. Instead of lukewarm water, I used room temperature water, which was a little too cold. Putting it in the refrigerator was also confusing in the recipe, because my yeast didn't get to activate yet, so it barely rose at all. When I took it out, it looked pretty much the same as before, so it ended up being really dense and not very bread-like.
<br/>
This weekend I tried again, and I got a little closer. I used warmer water this time, and instead of directly followed her recipe, I just let it rise outside for a little bit, which rose significantly more than last time. When I cooked it, I definitely got an airier bread, but next time I'll try letting it rise even more. Maybe I should also try using bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, I just have no idea what difference it will make.  
<br/>
Eventually I want to make good enough focaccia to use in sandwiches and flex it in front of all my friends.
