## **Intro**

This school year I'm stuck at school for 7:15 all the way to 3:17. Within this period of time, I'm fed a banana and a slice of cardboard pizza, or something else along those lines. As a result, the moment I get home, I need to consume. I have two choices, make something quick for myself, or eat leftovers. Since my mom started making very little for lunch now that I'm not there, I end up just making something for myself.  \

Lately that something has been Grilled Cheese. Which I've been refining and perfecting over a few weeks. \
\
Now, this isn't some basic-ass grilled cheese, but it ain't fancy cause I don't got the facilities for that. Here's my recipe: \

  1. Take 2 slices of sourdough bread. Spread mayonnaise on one side of each slice and toast them.  \
  2. After its browned, take it off the pan and spread mayonnaise on the other side. Slap one on the pan again, but leave the heat off.  \
  3. Put some cheese (I used meunster and swiss, but you can use whatever you want), some mustard, and salt on the slice, and then close the sandwich with the other. \
  4. Cook on both sides until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted. \
  5. Enjoy! \
