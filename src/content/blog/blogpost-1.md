This school year I'm stuck at school from 7:15 to 3:17. Within this period of time, I'm barely fed anything. As a result, I start searching for food the moment I get home. I usually have two choices, make something quick for myself, or eat leftovers. Since my mom started making very little for lunch now that I'm not there, I end up just making something for myself.  
   <br/>
Lately that something has been Grilled Cheese. Which I've been refining and perfecting over a few weeks.  
<br/>
Take 2 slices of sourdough bread. Spread mayonnaise on one side of each slice and toast them.  
<br/>
After its browned, take it off the pan and spread mayonnaise on the other side. Slap one on the pan again, but leave the heat off.  
<br/>
Put some cheese (I used meunster and swiss, but you can use whatever you want), some mustard, and salt on the slice, and then close the sandwich with the other.   
<br/>
Cook on both sides until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted.  
<br/>
Enjoy!
