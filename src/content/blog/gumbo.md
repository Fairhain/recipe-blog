A few weeks ago I decided to make Gumbo.  
   <br/>
I think it was cause of the Joshua Weissman video where he ranked every states food. He was talking so highly of Gumbo, and I realized I hadnt had that much Southern food, or stews, so I was curious.  
<br/>
Eventually I got around to actually making it, so I put aside some time and I knocked it out for lunch. 
<br/>   
Honestly it wasnt what I was expecting at all. It was spicy (mightve put too much pepper in there), but it was so good, especially when I just pour it over some rice. It was very warm and comforting, but savory and definitely something I want to make again. Ill also try jambalaya too. I also couldnt really tell if it was healthy or not. There was a lot of oil and flour in the roux that could have been bad, but everything else was pretty healthy.  
<br/>  
Also I have no idea why, but the following day I woke up and my throat was hurting. It hurt to swallow and stuff and I think it was cause of the Gumbo.  
<br/>
**RECIPE**    
<br/>  
Make a roux with equal parts oil and flour. Based on how much youre making but if I remember correctly it was 2 cups each. Mix on low-medium heat.  
<br/>  
You have to mix for a while, but eventually it will turn brown.  
<br/>  
Then take some chopped vegetables and throw them into the pot with the roux. I used celery, bell pepper, and onion. It should start sizzling and cooking very fast.  
<br/>
Right after that you want to throw in the meats. I used sausage and chicken.  
<br/>
The chicken should be pre cooked. Just take some chicken thighs, season them with whatever you want, maybe even some cajun seasoning, cook it, and shred it. I have no idea what type of sausage it called for, but I found some Cajun-style sausages in my grocery store so I just used those. You also have to pre-brown the sausages before adding them to the pot.  
<br/>
Now, since its a stew, you need to add some liquid in. I used part-chicken stock part-water. I prefer the chicken stock, so try to used a little more of that.  
<br/>
Finally, add some cajun seasoning and parsley on top, maybe add the seasoning and boil for longer, then add the parsley at the end, I dont know if it does much.   
<br/>
Serve with some rice and hopefully your throat doesnt hurt.
